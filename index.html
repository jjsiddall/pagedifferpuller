<h1> What it does </h1>
<p>This is my first post on the way to building a Page Differ Checker</p>

The goal of this page will be for the user to:
<ul>
  <li>Enter an endpoint or url</li>
  <li>Get feedback (in the form of an email) if that page has changed</li>
  <li>Get the new or changed data from the page</li>
  <li>Celebrate!</li>
</ul>
